# GUI-PyQT5-Youtub3r_Scrap3r

This is a 2days work, this time I wanted to start from the design of the application, I think is a best practice to starting the code after finished the designing process, after that I have to implement the code, and if I found something that is not good for the user experience I can change it easily.
